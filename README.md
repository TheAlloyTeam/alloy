**Alloy** is a starting point - the begining of a boilerplate and pattern library for all! Using HTML5, LESS and JavaScript to help us build both small and large scaleable websites.

## Upcoming features

* **Grids** - more grids than you can shake a stick at, with systems that work for varying viewport sizes
* **LESS** - base styles, mixins and patterns
* **Templates** - templates & patterns constructed with handlebars to help you start quickly using atomic theory
* **Grunt** - the system will use grunt to do a lot of the legwork and compilation of your static site
* **Accessibility** - we will be working closely to the guidelines to make sure that interactive elements are as accessible as they can be
* **Roll our own JavaScript** - We will spend the time to create JavaScript and jQuery plugins that answer the problems that we need them to rather than taking off-the-shelf solutions

So much to do and what a fun journey it will be :)

## Reference

This whole project is based and influenced by many boilerplates and helpers from around the web. I will try to include a full list here for reference.
